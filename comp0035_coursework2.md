## Requirements definition and analysis
The term 'requirements' is used in the broader sense, user stories and/or use cases may be used.




### Requirements identification methods
BABOK
1. Brainstorming
  To foster creative thinking about a problem, producing numerous new ideas and to derive themes for further analysis

User story and requirements
1. Dr. David, geologist
Dr. David is a geologist in UCL. His research focused on the model of volocano activity and global warming. Everytime, he wants to figure out the trend of eruptions in his interested volcano. He has to repeat the procedure of downloading, cleaning and visualising data. It is quite time-consuming. If an app can prepare and visualise data on his perferred chart, he shall save a lot of time on repeating pre-research.
2. Dr. Peter, US government scientist
Dr. Peter is an US government scientist, he is responsible for monitoring the volocano in US and send volocano alerts to the government and residents when necessary. However he needs to review the data and investigate the volocano which has abnormal eruption trends.

#### Charts
US01: As a geologist I want to tailor and save my preferences of types of charts so that I can save time on preparing and visualizing data.
US02: As a geologist I want to filter the data on the charts so that I can easily see the trend of my parcitularly interested volcano.
US03: As a geologist I want to subscribe my particular interested volocano and receive the notifications if it has a new eruption so that I can update my model with new and full data.
US04: As a government scientist, I want to receive alerts if the eruption frequency exceeds my thershold value so that I do not need to refresh and inverstigate national volocano data by myself.

#### Login
US05: As a geologist I want to be able to register and login with my eduaction account through SSO (Single Sign-On) so that I can access the data for free.

## Design
### Structure and flow of the interface
1. How syyhhould we perform the flow of the interface

### Relational database design

### Application structure


## Testing
### Choice of unit testing library

### Tests
The tests should be in a separate and appropriately named file/directory.

### Test results
Provide evidence that the tests have been run and the results of the tests (e.g. screenshot).

### Continuous integration (optional)
Consider using GitHub Actions (or other) to establish a continuous integration pipeline. If you do so then please provide a link to the .yml and a screenshot of the results of a workflow run.

# Coursework 2

## Major changes in target audience
After CW1, the target audience is changed because I have a clearer vision about the scope and use of the Volcano app. Now there are two different categories of the web users.
### Category I: Researchers
Researchers such as geologists from government, companies or universities who are looking to access some historical volcanic eruption data to provide a base data trend for their prediction models to improve the accuracy of their predictions. More accurate predictions can save a lot of damage and protect the residents lived near volcano.

### Category II: Residents lived near volcano
The app will send eruption alert according to the volcano prediction model to the residents. Meantime, the residents lived near volcano report the daily monitoring like temperature rise and ground vibrations for scientific research. In addition, the residents can also use the app to access the eruption data to simply know the trend of the volcano and the environment they lived with.

## Requirements definition and analysis
### Requirements identification methods
BABOK

1. Brainstorming
  To foster creative thinking about a problem, producing numerous new ideas and to derive themes for further analysis

2. Document Analysis
  Elicit REQ through the study of the available DOC of existing and comparable solutions, and identify relevants INFO

3. Interview
4. Ki

### Requirement specification method
User story is used to specify the requirements beacasue the project methodlogy selected is a combination of Scrum and CRISP-DM. User story is an important part in Agile method.
### Prioritisation method
MoSCoW

### Context diagram
The context diagram is used to visualise the interactions between the stakeholders, data repository and the app.

### Documented and prioritised requirements


#### Charts
US01: As a geologist I want to tailor and save my preferences of types of charts so that I can save time on preparing and visualizing data.
US02: As a geologist I want to filter the data on the charts so that I can easily see the trend of my parcitularly interested volcano.
US03: As a geologist I want to subscribe my particular interested volocano and receive the notifications if it has a new eruption so that I can update my model with new and full data.
US04: As a government scientist, I want to receive alerts if the eruption frequency exceeds my thershold value so that I do not need to refresh and monitor national volocano data by myself.

#### Login
US05: As a geologist worked in UCL, I want to be able to register and login with my eduaction account through SSO (Single Sign-On) so that I can access the data for free.


Non-functional
1. Successful login
2. Fluent experience

#### 1. Allow users to tailor visualisations and save their preferences


## Design
### Structure and flow of the interface
1. How syyhhould we perform the flow of the interface

### Relational database design

### Application structure


## Testing
### Choice of unit testing library

### Tests
The tests should be in a separate and appropriately named file/directory.

### Test results
Provide evidence that the tests have been run and the results of the tests (e.g. screenshot).

### Continuous integration (optional)
Consider using GitHub Actions (or other) to establish a continuous integration pipeline. If you do so then please provide a link to the .yml and a screenshot of the results of a workflow run.
